# Algorithms-on-Hardware-Bit-Counting-Circuit-using-ASM-chart-
This repository contains the verilog code, testbenches and simulations waveforms to show how Algorithmic State Machines (ASM) charts are used as a design tool that allow the specification of digital systems in a form similar to a flow chart. This project was designed in 
Altera's Quartus Prime using Verilog HDL. Modelsim Altera was used to view simulation waveforms. 

# Basic Understanding and Design Methodology
ASM chart for a bit counting circuit is shown below:

- It represents a circuit that counts the number of bits set to 1 in an n-bit input A .
- The rectangular boxes in this diagram represent the states of the digital system, and actions specified inside of a state box occur on each active clock edge in this state.
- Transitions between states are specified by arrows.
- The diamonds in the ASM chart represent conditional tests.
- The ovals represent actions taken only if the corresponding conditions are either true (on an arrow labeled 1) or false (on an arrow labeled 0).
- In this ASM chart, state S1 is the initial state. In this state the result is initialized to 0, and data is loaded into a register A, until a start signal, s, is asserted. The ASM chart then transitions to state S2, where it increments the result to count the number of
  1â€™s in register A. Since state S2 specifies a shifting operation. Also, since the result is incremented.  When register A contains 0 the ASM chart transitions to state S3, where it sets an output Done = 1 and waits for the signal s to be deasserted.

This ciruit was implemented on DE1-SOC. Various input and output modules of the board was used during this exercise.
- Slide switches ( 0 to 7) were used as 8-bit inputs.
- KEY0 was used as an synchorous reset.
- SW9 was used as a start signal.
- HEX0 ( seven segment display) was used to display the total number of ones in an n-bit input.
- LEDR9 was used as a finish signal.
